      <h3>The Super Shinobi II (1993)</h3>
      <p>Rather than just standing around with a sword, we see the shinobi in the middle of battle.What catapults this cover to the top (other than the incredible) detail is the gigantic moon in the back.</p>

      <h3>Golden Axe II (1991)</h3>
      <p>There’s a massive, hyper-muscular barbarian wearing a loincloth that barely covers his nether regions, a similarly scantily-clad Viking with just as much muscle mass, and a super-hot super-fit Amazoness unapologetically wearing a modern bikini while riding a dinosaur.</p>

      <h3>Toki: Going Ape Spit (1992)</h3>
      <p>The game is an exercise in unbound creativity. The setting is absurd, the main character’s powers are bizarre, and it all just feels like a fever dream from beginning to end.</p>
      <p>This can be inferred from the cover, which depicts magic monkey-man Toki doing what he does best: spitting out energy balls from his mouth at the local wildlife.</p>
      <p>Looking at the cover, you’d be forgiven for thinking Toki is actually the bad guy. I mean, his facial expression isn’t that of a hero…</p>

      <h3>Streets of Rage (Mega Drive) (1991)</h3>
      <p>The cover for widely-acclaimed beat-em-up Streets of Rage is pretty good on the NA release, but the European version is on another level.</p>

      <h3>Altered Beast (1988)</h3>
      <p>Altered Beast was a pack-in game for the Sega Genesis – and it was a fantastic way to start your gaming journey on Sega’s latest console.From the moment you lay eyes on the cover, you know you’re in for a wild (and violent) ride.

      <h3>Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium (JP) (1993)</h3>
      <p>When it comes to JRPG box art, the Japanese have a home advantage.</p>
      <p>The result is gorgeous scenes in the style of classic anime and manga from the 80s and 90s.</p>
      <p>The unapologetically Japanese art style allows for much detail, and it shines when it comes to machinery like the robot arm on the dangerously scantily-clad pink-haired lady on the back of the box.</p>

      <h3>Phantasy Star II (1989)</h3>
      <p>Not only is the art style gorgeous, but the scene sells you a space opera adventure the likes of which you’ve never seen before. There are futuristic weapons, bizarre insect-like alien critters, and a city overlooked by what looks like a giant eye lies in the distance.</p>

      <h3>ESWAT: City Under Siege (1990)</h3>
      <p>If you wanted a crazy sci-fi cover that looked realistic, you couldn’t just make 3D models – you had to hire an artist with a detailed, photorealistic art style and have them draw your wildest fantasies.</p>

      <h3>Forgotten Worlds (1988)</h3>
      <p>Why didn’t anybody tell me Destiny was based on an 80s side-scrolling shooter?</p>
      <p>Jokes aside, I can’t help but notice a striking similarity with the aesthetic of this box and my favorite looter-shooter. These two cool space marines look surprisingly like Guardians, and the giant planet behind them might as well be the Traveler.</p>
      <p>You just can’t go wrong with two beefcakes with big guns and even bigger biceps. The sunglasses are a nice touch that somehow assures me they’ll be able to take on whatever the game throws at them… if I don’t suck at the controls.</p>

      <h3>Sonic the Hedgehog (1991)</h3>
      <p>The first game in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise needed to make a splash so the mascot would stick, and the cover art was the first step in the long journey towards brand recognition.</p>

      <h3>Herzog Zwei (1990)</h3>
      <p>The artist’s mastery of perspective is exquisite. And the scene of jet fighters, ground-based forces, and colossal robots shooting it out couldn’t be more exciting.</p>

      <h3>Ghouls’ n Ghosts (1989)</h3>
      <p>Instead of just going for Ghosts’ n Goblins 2, Capcom decided to market the sequel to the iconic action platformer as something new – Ghouls’ n Goblins.</p>
      <p>I’m not a fan of their marketing logic.</p>
      <p>The game’s box art for the Sega Genesis version follows this logic, replacing the cartoony style of the original with a more realistic, badass scene of a golden-clad knight with a large lance ready to slay the headless demon that looms over him.</p>
